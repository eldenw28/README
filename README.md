# What are your primary goals as a human being?
I want to understand and to be understood.

I want to be happy (but will settle for content.)

I want to tell stories that get others to feel things.

# What do you want us to know about your communication style?
I'm shy at first, definitely an introvert. Once I know you and become comfortable, I can almost seem extroverted... until I meet the next new person. This definitely translates to group dynamics. In a mixed/new group, I tend to be quiet and let others do the talking. It's like this kind of super-politeness. I wait for everyone else to take their turn. Unless no one is going, then I go first because I know everyone is feeling awkward and I feel compelled to relieve the tension. So, if you want me to take the lead, I will do it as long as you let me know I'm not stepping on your toes.

I try to be careful in how I communicate because I'm mortified if I do something that offends but I'm also difficult to offend. Unless I think you're being intentionally mean, I try to pay attention to what you're saying, not how you say it. If I happen to offend you, I'll probably still be agonizing about it a year later. That's my problem, not yours.

My demeanor can sometimes seem a little stone-like. A past manager said I have an unreadable poker face. I feel a lot more than I let on. Because of this, it might seem like I don't care. I can assure you it's the complete opposite. I care about you very much! I just don't articulate those kinds of emotions well.

I joke to relieve tension. That includes poking at authority figures. At my first tech job, I sassed the CEO on my first day. He started it! I like to work with people who have a sense of humor and I figure you might as well learn that about someone right away. Yeah, sometimes that backfires.

# What are some useful things to know in advance about your style?
While I'm in data gathering mode, I might seem tentative and indecisive but I'm just trying to learn enough to draw a conclusion. Once I've gathered enough information, I can be confident, decisive and efficient. That doesn't mean I haven't already formed an initial opinion though. You just might have to prompt me if you want to know what it is before I'm ready to share. I'm not trying to be obtuse, it's just a defense mechanism whose origin I can't identify.

Along those lines, that also means that I don't believe I "think on my feet" well. If you ask me for my thoughts right away I'll share them and they might be all you needed, but if you give me some time to think things over first, I'll come back with something that's very well thought out. I'll probably keep thinking about it either way so it can sometimes be valuable to check back in.

I have this intense fear of being a bother or burden. This can make me abrupt and can appear to be the opposite; like you're bothering me, maybe. Let's say we're having a Zoom call, we've come to the end and I just quickly say bye and hang up. That's me trying not to take up/waste your time, not you impinging on mine.

# How can you best work with me?
I take instruction well. If I feel any distress over what you're telling me, I treat the distress as my issue unless I think you're being intentionally mean. 

I prefer to get feedback right away if possible. It's like driving a car down the freeway. I'd rather know something is wrong by rumbling over the safety bumps rather than after we're in a ditch on the side of the road.

Email and Slack are fine but they can also fail to convey tone. I suppose Slack emojis help with that some but if it feels like we're not quite communicating in a written form, I'm quite happy to hop onto Zoom. When I've worked in an office in the past, I preferred to just come by your desk and talk something out (after checking if you were available) rather than go back and forth in writing. I once worked with someone who said that once you've gone past a couple of paragraphs in an email, it's probably quicker to just hop on the phone and I sort of took that to heart.

# What are your pet peeves?
I don't like close mindedness. In my worldview there are very few things of which you can be absolutely certain. New information should require reassessment of pretty much any position. I've known too many people who reach a certain point in their life and then succumb to what I call rigid thinking. Keep your mind flexible.

There's way too much plastic.

Loud engines.

People who don't conform to my worldview on proper sidewalk and grocery store aisle etiquette.


# What are your self-perceived biggest shortcomings?
I'm a great employee. I'll work my rear off for my employer... unless the employer is me. sigh.

I'm still very hard on myself. I'm trying to get better about it. I've at least reached the point where Iâ€™m usually not abusive anymore. Work in progress.

I definitely tend to underestimate myself. It's like this:

"Hey, Elden, what do you know about X?"

"Not a lot."

"Do you know this about X?"

"Yes."

"What about this and this?"

"Yes."

"What about this?"

"Yes."

"Seems like you know a lot about X."

"If you say so."
